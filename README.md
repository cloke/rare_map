rare_map
=============

Relational db to ActiveRecord models Mapper

It does the reverse engineering to convert existing databases to ActiveRecord models.

Features:

 1. Rebuiding associations.

 2. Rebuiding attribute accessors(Optional in Rails 4).

 3. Providing an interactive console which is like Rails console.

 4. Table or column names which are out of convention can be matched by configuraiton.
    (Plural and singular words are already matched automatically.)

 5. Can be used for BOTH standalone application & Rails

#### Installation:
```ruby
gem install rare_map
```

Basic RareMap Usage
-------------

#### Standalone:
Create a new rare_map.yml with following lines in the root of your application

#### Rails:
Create a new config/rare_map.yml with following lines in rails

rare_map.yml:
```yaml
  legacy:
    adapter: sqlite3
    database: db/db1.sqlite3

  old_db:
    adapter: mysql2
    host: localhost
    database: db_name
    port: 3306
    username: user
    password: pw
```

Run following command in the root of your application or rails
```
$ raremap
```

Standalone: A demo.rb example is generated for you in the root of your application

RareMap console which is like rails console for standalone app can be run by following command
```
$ raremap console  # or simply run `raremap c`
```

Advanced RareMap Usage
-------------

#### Seperate databases into groups (highly recommended)
```yaml
  her_group:
    -
      db1:
        adapter: sqlite3
        database: db/db1.sqlite3
    -
      db2:
        adapter: sqlite3
        database: db/db1.sqlite3

  his_group:
    -
      db1:
        adapter: sqlite3
        database: db/db3.sqlite3
    -
      db2:
        adapter: sqlite3
        database: db/db4.sqlite3
````

There are benefits by separating databases into groups:

1. Associations are built between databases within a group

2. Group name is treated as a module namespace

3. Models of a group are organized within a folder

If all your data reside in several legacy databases, it is important to build back those associations across databases

If there are 2 or more tables with the same name, giving them group names could avoid naming collision

If there are tons of tables, it is better to organize them well


#### Set up RareMap Options
```yaml
  rare_map_opts:
    foreign_key:
      suffix: fk
      alias:
        abnormal_fk1: table1
        abnormal_fk2: table2
    primary_key:
      table1: abnormal_pk
```

* rare_map_opts[foreign_key][suffix]: If your foreign keys are not ended with 'id', you can specify the suffix you want here
* rare_map_opts[foreign_key][alias]: If naming convention is not followed by some foreign keys, you can list them here
* rare_map_opts[primary_key]: Usually rare_map can identify the primary key of a table, if it fails, please list primary keys here

#### RareMap Options Precedence

You can place rare_map options in 3 ways
```yaml
  rare_map_opts:             # Global options
    ...
  group1:
    -
      rare_map_opts:         # Group options
        ...
    -
      db1:
        ...
  legacy_db:
    adapter: sqlite3
    database: db/db.sqlite3
    rare_map_opts:           # DB options
      ...
```
Precedence: DB > Group > Global
